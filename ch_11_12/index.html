<h1>PIAIC</h1>
P RESI D E N T I A L I N I T I A TIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE
A ND C O M P U T I N G
Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-
for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and
Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
fields like
Cloud Native Computing
Artificial Intelligence
Blockchain
Internet Of Things
C loud Native computing:
The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source
technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native
while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
A rtificial Intelligence:
The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas,
Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
B lockchain:
The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum
and Hyperledger (Fabric), and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
(DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-
service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.

I nternet of Things:
The Internet of things program introduces the students to open source development
technologies like Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
and Kubernetes while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
