    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and
         ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with
          other substances.</p>

        <li><dt>Organic Chemistry:</dt></li>
        <dd>Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of 
            carbon-containing compounds, which include not only hydrocarbons but also compounds with any number of 
            other elements, including hydrogen (most compounds contain at least one carbonâ€“hydrogen bond), nitrogen, 
            oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur. This branch of chemistry was originally limited to
            compounds produced by living organisms but has been broadened to include human-made substances such as
            plastics. The range of application of organic compounds is enormous and also includes, but is not limited
            to, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food, explosives, paints, and cosmetics.</dd>

        <li><dt>Inorganic Chemistry:</dt></li>
        <dd>Inorganic chemistry is concerned with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include
            metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds.</dd>
        <br />
        <li><dt>Physical Chemistry:</dt></li>
        <dd>Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms 
            of the principles, practices, and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics,
            quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, analytical dynamics and chemical equilibrium.
